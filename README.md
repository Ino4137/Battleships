My first git-hub archived project. This is a simple re-make of the game 'Battleships' using Python.

To start the game input: ```python Run.py```

The game is designed to work on Linux. Some of the functions will not work if run on Windows/OS X.

Currently, the game has a simple GUI on the command line, listing all the actions taken up to this point.

TODO:

*Implement visualize

*Advanced guessing AI
